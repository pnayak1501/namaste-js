## Episode 1 - How JavaScript Works üî•& Execution Context
"Everything in javascript happens inside an Execution Context" <br>
"Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language" <br>

Execution context is divided into two parts, that is, the memory part and the other is code part. In the memory part the variables and functions are stored in a key-value pair.

## Episode 2 - How JavaScript Code is executed? ‚ù§Ô∏è& Call Stack
When a javascript program is executed, an execution context is created. The Execution context is created in 2 phases - Creation phase(Memory creation phase) and Code execution phase. <br>

For the given code, in the first phase, JS will allocate memory to all the variables and functions. <br>
Memory part: <br>
n : undefined <br>
square : { ... }       //Stores the whole code of the function <br>
square2 : undefined <br>
square4 : undefined <br>

In the second phase, JS will execute the code. <br>
Memory part: <br>
n : 2 <br>
square : { ... }       //Stores the whole code of the function <br>
square2 : undefined <br>
square4 : undefined <br>

When a function is being invoked, a new execution context is being created. <br>
The new execution context for the function in phase 1: <br>
Memory part: <br>
num : undefined <br>
ans : undefined <br>

The new execution context for the function in phase 2: <br>
Memory part: <br>
num : 2 <br>
ans : 4  //num * num is executed in the code part and the result is stored in ans <br>

return keyword specifies that return the control of the program back to the place where the function was invoked. <br>
