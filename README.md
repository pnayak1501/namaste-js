## Episode 1 - How JavaScript Works üî•& Execution Context
![](namaste/episode1.png) <br>

"Everything in javascript happens inside an Execution Context" <br>
"Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language" <br>

Execution context is divided into two parts, that is, the memory part and the other is code part. In the memory part the variables and functions are stored in a key-value pair.

## Episode 2 - How JavaScript Code is executed? ‚ù§Ô∏è& Call Stack
![](namaste/episode2.png) <br>

When a javascript program is executed, an execution context is created. The Execution context is created in 2 phases - Creation phase(Memory creation phase) and Code execution phase. <br>

For the given code, in the first phase, JS will allocate memory to all the variables and functions. <br>
Memory part: <br>
n : undefined <br>
square : { ... }       //Stores the whole code of the function <br>
square2 : undefined <br>
square4 : undefined <br>

In the second phase, JS will execute the code. <br>
Memory part: <br>
n : 2 <br>
square : { ... }       //Stores the whole code of the function <br>
square2 : 4 <br>
square4 : 16 <br>

When a function is being invoked, a new execution context is being created. <br>
The new execution context for the function in phase 1: <br>
Memory part: <br>
num : undefined <br>
ans : undefined <br>

The new execution context for the function in phase 2: <br>
Memory part: <br>
num : 2 <br>
ans : 4  //num * num is executed in the code part and the result is stored in ans <br>

return keyword specifies that return the control of the program back to the place where the function was invoked. Once the program has been completed executed, the whole execution context is deleted. <br>

The Call stack is used to manage all the execution contexts. <br>
"Call Stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts" <br>
Call stack = Execution context stack = Program stack = Control stack = Runtime stack = Machine stack

## Episode 3 - Hoisting in JavaScript üî•(variables & functions)

Hoisting is a phenomenon in JS by which we can access these variables and functions even before we have inititalized it. <br>
Firstly, the JS scans through the code and reserves the memory for all the variables and functions and for the variables, it stores the value of the variable and for the functions, we store the actual function defination. So, while printing the function and variable before they were initilized, the variables print undefined as their value and functions print the actual function defination. <br>
