"Everything in javascript happens inside an Execution Context" <br>
"Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language" <br>

Execution context is divided into two parts, that is, the memory part and the other is code part. In the memory part the variables and functions are stored in a key-value pair.

Memory part: 
n : undefined
square : { ... }       //Stores the whole code
